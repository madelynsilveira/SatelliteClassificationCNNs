# Functional Map of the World (fMoW) RGB Dataset
The data in this bucket represents the JPEG-compressed RGB version of the dataset that was created for the fMoW Challenge. There is another bucket located at s3://spacenet-dataset/fmow/fmow-full that contains the same imagery as this bucket except that all imagery is in a less-compressed TIFF format and multispectral imagery contains 4 or 8 channels of information. The fMoW-full dataset is significantly larger in size, but recommended for those of you who would like less compressed imagery and/or intend to utilize multispectral information.

## The Problem
Intelligence analysts, policy makers, and first responders around the world rely on geospatial land use data to inform crucial decisions about global defense and humanitarian activities. Historically, analysts have manually identified and classified geospatial information by comparing and analyzing satellite images, but that process is time consuming and insufficient to support disaster response.

The fMoW Challenge seeks to foster breakthroughs in the automated analysis of overhead imagery by harnessing the collective power of the global data science and machine learning communities. Can you build algorithms to classify facility, building, and land use from satellite imagery?  We are inviting solvers from around the world to develop deep learning and other automated techniques to classify points of interest from satellite imagery.
